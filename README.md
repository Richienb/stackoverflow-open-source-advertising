StackOverflow Open Source Advertising
=================

This website was created for the sole reason that StackOverflow doesn't allow domains other than itself to refrence an ad.

To use this service, simply add the following HTML code to your website

```html
<iframe src="https://stackoverflow-open-source-advertising.glitch.me" width="300" height="250" frameborder="0"></iframe>
```

By default, the content of `https://stackoverflow.com/ossads/300x250` is shown.

You can change the width and height parameters by adding query parameters. For example: `https://stackoverflow-open-source-advertising.glitch.me?width=300&height=250`.

You can also cancel the margin removal by providing the `margin=true` parameter
